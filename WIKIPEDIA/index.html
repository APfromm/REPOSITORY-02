                <p><b>Alexander Pfromm</b> (Born November 10, 2001) is an American citizen and current student
                    at the Berks Campus of the Pennsylvania State University. Alex is currently studying towards a
                    Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity, and is looking forward to utilizing his expansive knowledge
                    of the principles of computing to improve security and safety in an
                    increasingly challenging technological environment. </p><br>
                <h2>Early Life</h2><hr><br>
                <p> Alex was born in the Reading Hospital & Medical Center on Saturday, November 10, 2001.
                    He is the youngest son of Maureen Noll and Robert Pfromm, and brother of John Pfromm.
                    Alex's early life was marked by a typical upbringing in a family environment.
                    Raised by his parents in
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernville,_Pennsylvania">Bernville, Pennsylvania</a>,
                    Alex displayed interests across various domains, encompassing both the sciences and the arts.
                    As with many individuals, his experiences in childhood contributed to shaping the person he would
                    become in his later years. At age 15, Jimmy recommended Tommy to replace Russ Morgan in the
                    Scranton Sirens, a territory band in the 1920s. Tommy and Jimmy worked in bands led by
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Whiteman">Paul Whiteman</a>, Rudy Vallee, and
                    Nat Shilkret. In 1923, Dorsey followed Jimmy to Detroit to play in Jean Goldkette's band and
                    returned to New York in 1925 to play with the California Ramblers. In 1929, the Dorsey Brothers
                    had their first hit with "Coquette" for Okeh Records. In 1934, the Dorsey Brothers band signed with
                    Decca, having a hit with "I Believe in Miracles".
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Miller">Glenn Miller</a> was a member of the
                    Dorsey Brothers Orchestra in 1934 and 1935, composing "Annie's Cousin Fanny" and
                    "Tomorrow's Another Day" for the band. Acrimony between the brothers led to
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Dorsey">Tommy Dorsey</a> walking out to form his
                    own band in 1935 as the orchestra was having a hit with "Every Little Moment". Dorsey's orchestra
                    was known primarily for its renderings of ballads at dance tempos, frequently with singers such as
                    Jack Leonard and Frank Sinatra. </p><br>
                <h2>Career</h2><hr><br>
                <p> In late 1937, Goodman's publicist Wynn Nathanson suggested that Goodman and his band play
                    Carnegie Hall in New York City. The sold-out concert was held on the evening of January 16, 1938.
                    It is regarded as one of the most significant in jazz history. After years of work by musicians
                    from all over the country, jazz had finally been accepted by mainstream audiences.
                    Recordings of the concert were made, but even by the technology of the day the equipment used was
                    not of the finest quality. Acetate recordings of the concert were made, and aluminum studio masters
                    were cut. The recording was produced by Albert Marx as a special gift for his wife, Helen Ward,
                    and a second set for Benny. He contracted Artists Recording Studio to make two sets.
                    Artists Recording only had two turntables, so they farmed out the second set to Raymond Scott's
                    recording studio. It was Benny's sister-in-law who found the recordings in Benny's apartment
                    in 1950 and brought them to Benny's attention. Goodman took the discovered recording to Columbia,
                    and a selection was issued on LP as The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert.
                    Pianist and arranger Mary Lou Williams suggested to Hammond that he see
                    guitarist Charlie Christian. Hammond had seen Christian perform in Oklahoma City in 1939 and
                    recommended him to Goodman, but Goodman was uninterested in electric guitar and was put off by
                    Christian's taste in gaudy clothing. During a break at a concert in Beverly Hills, Hammond inserted
                    Christian into the band. Goodman started playing "Rose Room" on the assumption that Christian
                    didn't know it, but his performance impressed everyone. Christian was a member of the
                    Benny Goodman Sextet from 1939 to 1941, and during these two years he turned the
                    electric guitar into a popular jazz instrument. Goodman continued his success throughout the late
                    1930s with his big band, his trio and quartet, and the sextet formed in August 1939, the same month
                    Goodman returned to Columbia Records after four years with RCA Victor. At Columbia, John Hammond,
                    his future brother-in-law, produced most of his sessions. By the mid-1940s, however, big bands
                    had lost much of their popularity. In 1941, ASCAP had a licensing war with music publishers. From
                    1942 to 1944, and again in 1948, the musicians' union went on strike against the major record
                    labels in the United States, and singers acquired the popularity that the big bands
                    had once enjoyed. During the 1942â€“44 strike, the War Department approached the union and requested
                    the production of V-Discs, a set of records containing new recordings for soldiers, thereby
                    boosting the rise of new artists. Also, by the late 1940s, swing was
                    no longer the dominant style of jazz musicians. </p><br>
                <h2>Personal Life</h2><hr><br>
                <p> Louis Armstrong thought enough of Miller to carry around his recordings when he went on tour.
                    Armstrong liked musicians who prized melody, and his selections ranged from Glenn Miller to
                    Jelly Roll Morton to Tchaikovsky. Jazz pianist George Shearing's quintet of the 50s and 60s was
                    influenced by Miller, with Shearing's locked hands style piano, influenced by the voicing of
                    Miller's saxophone section in the middle of the harmonies. Frank Sinatra and Mel Torme
                    held the orchestra in high regard. Torme credited Miller with giving him helpful advice when
                    he first started his singing and songwriting career in the 1940s. Torme met Miller in 1942,
                    the meeting facilitated by Torme's father and bandleader Ben Pollack. Torme and Miller discussed
                    "That Old Black Magic", which was just emerging as a new song by Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen.
                    Miller told Torme to pick up every song by Mercer and study it, and to become a voracious reader of
                    anything he could find, because all good lyric writers are great readers. In an interview
                    with George T. Simon in 1948, Sinatra lamented the inferior quality of music he was recording
                    in the late 40s, in comparison with "those great Glenn Miller things" from years earlier.
                    Frank Sinatra's recording sessions from the late 40s and early 50s use some Miller musicians.
                    Trigger Alpert, a bassist from Miller's civilian band, Zeke Zarchy from the Army Air Forces
                    orchestra and Willie Schwartz, the lead clarinetist from the civilian band
                    back up Sinatra on many recordings. </p><br>
